Dataset 2
==========

This is a tidy dataset that meets the last requirement as described in the TidyDataOverview.txt.

Here are the steps used to create the dataset:
	1. select only the relevent columns from dataset1 (subject,calculation,readingtype,activitydescription,value)
	2. apply the "ddply" functin in R to create a mean value for each combination of subject,calculation,readingtype,
	   and activitydescription 

There are 5 columns in the dataset described below:
	1. subject = the number of the test subject that performed the activity
	2. calculation = calculation = (mean / std) - what calculation the value represents
	3. readingtype = the type of reading (see features_info.txt for more information)
	4. activitydescription (valid values are in activity_description.txt) - a description of the activity that occurred
	5. average = the average for the combination of subject, calculation, readingtype, and activitydescription
