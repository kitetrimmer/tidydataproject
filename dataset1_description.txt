Dataset 1
==========

This is a tidy dataset that meets the first 4 requirements as described in the TidyDataOverview.txt.

Here are the steps used to create the dataset: 

	1.The subjects (from subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt) and activities (from y_test.txt and 
	  ytrain.txt) were joined to their respective reading tables (x_test and x_train).

	2. The features.txt was used to name the columns of the data from x_test and x_train.

	3. The columns that contained "mean()" and "std()" in the variable name were selected

	4. The data was "melted" into data frames containing the activity, the subject, the variable, and the value.

	5. The source of the data was added to the melted tables (train or test)

	6. The two datasets were merged together to make one consolidated dataset

	7. The variable was split into 4 variables, dimension, calculation, domain, and reading type

	8. An ActivityDescription column was created by merging the activity_description.txt based on the activity column

	9. Unneccessary columns were removed from the dataset (activity, variable)

	10. Data values were cleaned up by:
	a. removing the parenthesis '()' from the calculationtype
	b. changing the signaltype from "t" to "time" and "f" to "frequency"

There are 8 columns in the dataset described below:

	1. subject = the number of the test subject that performed the activity
	2. value = the value recorded on the accelerometer
	3. source = test / train - which file the data was recorded in
	4. diimension = (x /y/ z ) - what dimension the recording applies to 
	5. calculation = (mean / std) - what calculation the value represents
	6. domain = (time / frequency) - what domain the recording is (see features_info.txt for more information)
    7. readingtype = the type of reading (see features_info.txt for more information)
	8. activitydescription (valid values are in activity_description.txt) - a description of the activity that occurred
