Data Tidying
============

This data was tidied to meet requirements from the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course from Coursera.  These requirements are:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable 
computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and 
Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new
users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected 
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full 
description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with
   the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
Data that was described in 'features_info' was tidied using the R script "run_analysis".  The only arguement required
by this script is the directory that the original data is stored in, and the output is two .csv files:
  * dataset1 which selects the means and standard deviations from the dataset, and tidys it as described in steps 1-4 above.  
  * dataset2 which contains an average for each variable and each subject
  
 For detailed descriptions of each dataset see their respective description .txt (dataset1-description.txt or 
 dataset2-description.txt)
